To whomever it may concern,

	I am writing to urge you to deeply contemplate my plan regarding the rehabilitation of the Western African nations of Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone in the aftermath of the worst Ebola epidemic in human history. The outbreak brought a humanitarian crisis to the region and in many ways these countries remain unprepared for the next outbreak to occur. In light of the coronavirus pandemic, I ask you to implement this plan as soon as possible.
  
	My research focuses on building up healthcare infrastructure and public trust in government after a dearth of these contributed to the thousands of deaths caused by Ebola. Taking action has vital consequences for the entire world, as the need for international support led to Ebola spreading across the globe in isolated fashion. Support for rural areas without adequate access to health facilities is another huge concern with the new virus. Finally, cost and poverty must be addressed in an area ranked at the bottom of the world in human development.
  
	Research methods used to analyze how the regionâ€™s governments can improve their responses focus mainly on human mobility. Cell phone data allows for reliable real-time analysis of how people are traveling within and between districts. Covariates for mobility can accurately predict the spread of disease with the use of a gravity model and a radiation model. Each of these methods displayed great promise during Ebola, but they must be adapted to address concerns such as lack of coverage for the poor and the previous absence of a dataset for mobility that is guaranteed to provide reliable results.
  
	To solve these problems, I propose a multilayered idea that will provide a needed boost to West African societies. A council will be formed for each of the three countries, consisting of equal representation of each political party and independent health experts from around the world. This committee will be granted authority to build new hospitals in regions where healthcare is sporadic. Additionally, the council, with help from leaders at the local level, will create an education program that teaches populations about the importance of quarantine and trusting health officials in order to limit violence of the scale that was seen during Ebola. Finally, a quarantine bracelet program will allow for new opportunities to track mobility data and improve government strategy in real time. I believe this is the best way to ensure West African prosperity even in the face of crisis to ensure that no one is denied the human right that is health.
  
	Sincerely,
