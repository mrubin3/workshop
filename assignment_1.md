## Problem Statement

My research intends to resolve the extent to which government error contributed to the spread of the Ebola virus in West Africa and apply the findings to future outbreaks on the same scale. Weak and decentralized states severely limit healthcare systems and throttle chances to contain outbreaks by regulating travel across international borders. As a result, other serious illnesses such as cholera and malaria have been prevalent in the region for decades. Furthermore, in instances of true national disaster like the Ebola epidemic, a weak state cannot effectively take the measures necessary to restore order, leading to harsh distrust of the government by the general public that can have serious long-term repercussions for a nation’s stability. I wish to establish a link between fragile states and disasters such as epidemics in order to find ways to maintain sustainable human development while ensuring public trust in government remains.

This paper intended to study how certain travel factors in West Africa, such as urban migrations and illegal border crossings, impacted the spread of Ebola Virus Disease during the height of the outbreak in 2014-15. Authors Kraemer et al. utilize data regarding human mobility in order to estimate the movement of individuals within the affected region and analyze how such movement played a role in spreading the disease. As the paper was published after the conclusion of the outbreak, the authors do not seek a short-term solution to an immediate problem; instead, they wish to present solutions to halt a future outbreak of a similar magnitude. Disease outbreaks have a long and deadly history throughout West Africa, with yellow fever, cholera, and polio all presenting major issues in the past and the former two persisting to this day. The paper’s analysis is therefore quite relevant to the region even with the area’s most infamous outbreak over.
	The article evokes comparison to the idea of human development proposed by Amartya Sen. One of the main points raised by Kraemer et al. is that the governments of Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone attempted to limit border crossings to prevent Ebola spread. However, attempts to limit the freedom of citizens failed miserably, as each government was too weak to actually enforce the closed borders. In addition, citizens held a heavy distrust for the state, leading more people to leave and making containment even more difficult, suggesting that freedom does indeed play a major role in human development. The authors mainly focus on the disaster management, epidemiology, infrastructure, and transportation modeling aspects of human development. Furthermore, the paper considers the third and sixteenth UN human development goals regarding good health and strong institutions. In mapping the study, the authors use publicly available data from the World Health Organization and Integrated Public Use Microdata Series. Many different data science techniques appear in the paper, mainly as models used to estimate the movement of people within and between affected countries. In addition, models mapped the transmission of disease and predicted which districts contributed most to its spread. Finally, the authors sought to answer the questions of whether underlying factors such as a weak state contributed to the spread of Ebola, whether restricted freedoms implemented during the outbreak may have worsened its effects, and whether the transportation data can be used to combat epidemics in the future.

In this paper, authors Dudas et al. analyze the genomes of the Ebola virus to infer how its spread impacted managed to infect thousands of people in West Africa. They wish to depict the failure of closed borders and answer the question of why the epidemic did not spread beyond the three worst affected nations, utilizing epidemiology and migration as development problems. Analysis of the virus genomes reveals that most viral transmission occurred within a short distance, suggesting that border controls had little impact in halting the spread of Ebola. This problem ties into the underlying issues of weak states, poverty, and widespread distrust of government, all prevalent in West African nations such as Liberia and Sierra Leone.
	Dudas et al. relate to Amartya Sen’s vision of human development by addressing how practices of unfreedom prolonged the disaster. Detailed research of the viral transmission suggests that in spite of measures taken to limit transborder activities, much of the spread of Ebola in the later stages of the epidemic occurred across borders. Furthermore, the closures occurred too late to prevent the disease from establishing a foothold in Liberia and Sierra Leone. As a result, future development in this region should focus on sustainable goals such as good health and sanitation. Publicly available Ebola genomes are the main datasets employed to project the impacts of the virus, with administrative regions also being tracked to enable comparisons between countries. Data science methods utilized in this study include sequencing specific parts of the genome and applying them to models that eventually create predictors to determine which geographic and economic features of West Africa allowed the virus to spread rapidly. Dudas et al. further expand their analysis into specific regions, studying why certain provinces had very high virulence and others had virtually no transmission. They found a gravity model to be a strong fit for the provincial data, with high population density areas seeing the most disease transmission.

O., Bengtsson, L., Population mobility reductions associated with travel restrictions during the Ebola epidemic in Sierra Leone: use of mobile phone data, International Journal of Epidemiology, Volume 47, Issue 5, October 2018, Pages 1562–1570, https://doi.org/10.1093/ije/dyy095

This paper covers a different approach to tracking the spread of Ebola, relying on data from mobile phones to estimate the amount of travel within and between impacted countries. Authors Peak et al. try to answer the question of whether government restrictions implanted to curtail the virus had any effect on slowing its virology, with a primary focus on epidemiology and transportation modeling as their development problems. Their main finding was that mobile phone data proved effective in tracking populations in the epidemic area and they strongly recommended that governments around the world begin to employ mobile phone data to limit the effects of a future epidemic. Phone data can help states in regions such as West Africa determine whether travel limitations on the scale of Ebola are feasible for upcoming issues.
	As in Amartya Sen’s definition of human development, Peak et al. argue that while restrictions did limit long-distance travel in Sierra Leone, their impacts varied drastically across the country. Indeed, they posit that sub-national quarantines may have been more harmful than national ones since transmission within smaller administrative areas was generally more widespread than crossborder infection. Data used to carry out this research came from a list of travel restrictions operated by the World Health Organization, a list of daily suspected and confirmed cases produced by Fang et al., and a collection of call detail records from a prominent phone operator in Sierra Leone. Their methods include aggregating the number of phone subscribers and utilizing “crossover analysis” to highlight abnormal travel patterns among mobile users for specific periods of time. They also noted the economic status of destinations to which passengers from the three affected West African nations were travelling. Finally, they employed an anomaly detection algorithm to eliminate deviant values and an “intervention analysis” to register the size of the impacts of travel limits. Peak et al. concluded that the measures to halt Ebola spread were technically successful, since the amount of travel immediately following the restrictions decreased sharply. However, they caused much higher collateral damage in high density areas than less populated rural regions. They conclude by addressing the scientific question of whether mobile phone data can reliably project population movement during major disasters on the level of the Ebola epidemic. Upon analyzing their results, they were able to conclude that phone data is a useful tool for tracking travel limits in periods of crisis. However, they cautioned that governments must continue to develop their technology and use it well in order to make proper decisions in the best interest of their people.

This paper analyzes the impact of travel on the spread of Ebola across the most heavily impacted West African nations. Bogoch et al. wish to assess the question of whether screening and border closures correlated with finding and containing individuals carrying the virus, using transportation modeling and infrastructure as the main development problems. Their data reveals that exit screening at airports would be the most successful way to help curtail a future outbreak, but suggest that such measures would require international support due to the limited ability of West African governments to install them, making the prospect much more complicated than it initially appears.
	Similarly to the Amartya Sen definition of human development, Bogoch et al. imply that forced unfreedoms will lead to negative effects on the population and may fail to accomplish their original purpose. However, the presence of freedom is not necessarily a guarantee of protection, as the paper emphasizes the potential to contract the disease in public areas of an international airport. Therefore, efforts to develop West Africa to prevent future outbreaks should include improvements to sanitation and infrastructure. Data utilized in this study relied on International Air Transport Association flight schedules from September 2014 to the end of the year and Ebola surveillance data. Methods used include the creation of models of international Ebola infections in West Africa with the end goal of predicting how many air travellers were likely to contract the virus. In the end, these models helped the authors answer their scientific question of whether the spread of the virus was linked to socioeconomic variables such as poverty and whether these variables led to a significant change in travel patterns. The paper concludes by appealing for improved screening methods at airports in places with an elevated risk of diseases like Ebola. Bogoch et al. ask for West African leaders to balance possible harms of travel restrictions with the benefits, noting the backlash that may arise from limiting freedom of movement.

This study from the National Institutes of Health aims to measure the impact of the Ebola epidemic on the people affected by the disease. Authors Calnan et al. attempt to illustrate the impacts of the outbreak on a personal level through interviews and questionnaires, focusing on the socioeconomic analysis and disaster response elements of development. Among their findings was the notion that distrust of authority played a major role in worsening the effects of the epidemic, with witnesses describing problems such as community rejection of health workers and tension over regulations prohibiting cultural traditions including washing of bodies before burial. In an area of the world where such traditions hold extreme importance, finding a method to prevent outbreaks while maintaining the trust of the public is imperative.
	As with the definition of human development proposed by Amartya Sen, Calnan et al. emphasize the impact of cultural customs on a nation’s development, as many subjects suggested that performing burial rites took priority over ensuring their safety from the virus. This relates to sustainable development goals such as sanitation and infrastructure as defined by the UN, as the authors argue that West African countries should find a way to strengthen healthcare options in a way that does not conflict with traditional rites. In order to obtain their data, the authors produced their own set of interviews, balancing out the numbers to get inputs from researchers, ethics committees, government and community representatives, health workers, and survivors of the disease. Researchers attempted to discover the priorities of each of these groups of stakeholders to determine which course of action would work for a future epidemic. Additionally, all data was compared with at least two other sources of data collection to ensure validity. In their findings, the authors heavily emphasize how subjects did not trust health workers, complicating the response to the virus. Communities were largely torn apart by the epidemic, as with governments largely unable to provide resources necessary to recover, many villages were forced to rely on international humanitarian organizations for support. In conclusion, Calnan et al. wish to answer the scientific questions of what the long term impacts of the virus on West African culture and economies are, how the outbreak impacted the lives of survivors, and how the world can learn from the epidemic to develop strategies to better combat outbreaks in the future.
