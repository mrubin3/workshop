## Problem Statement

## Annotations

This paper intended to study how certain travel factors in West Africa, such as urban migrations and illegal border crossings, impacted the spread of Ebola Virus Disease during the height of the outbreak in 2014-15. Authors Kraemer et al. utilize data regarding human mobility in order to estimate the movement of individuals within the affected region and analyze how such movement played a role in spreading the disease. As the paper was published after the conclusion of the outbreak, the authors do not seek a short-term solution to an immediate problem; instead, they wish to present solutions to halt a future outbreak of a similar or greater magnitude. Disease outbreaks have a long and deadly history throughout West Africa, with yellow fever, cholera, and polio all presenting major issues in the past and the former two persisting to this day. The paper’s analysis is therefore quite relevant to the region even with the area’s most infamous outbreak over.
	
The article evokes comparison to the idea of human development proposed by Amartya Sen. One of the main points raised by Kraemer et al. is that the governments of Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone attempted to limit border crossings to prevent Ebola spread. However, attempts to limit the freedom of citizens failed miserably, as each government was too weak to actually enforce the closed borders. In addition, citizens held a heavy distrust for the state, leading more people to leave and making containment even more difficult, suggesting that freedom does indeed play a major role in human development. The authors mainly focus on the disaster management, epidemiology, infrastructure, and transportation modeling aspects of human development. Furthermore, the paper considers the third and sixteenth UN human development goals regarding good health and strong institutions. In mapping the study, the authors use publicly available data from the World Health Organization and Integrated Public Use Microdata Series. Many different data science techniques appear in the paper, mainly as models used to estimate the movement of people within and between affected countries. In addition, models mapped the transmission of disease and predicted which districts contributed most to its spread. Finally, the authors sought to answer the questions of whether underlying factors such as a weak state contributed to the spread of Ebola, whether restricted freedoms implemented during the outbreak may have worsened its effects, and whether the transportation data can be used to combat epidemics in the future.
