# Question: Our question related to the reading for today.  Nieves et a. use the random forest machine learning method to predict what value globally?  Describe in detail how random forest works.  What is a dasymmetric population allocation? Which geospatial covariates proved to be the most important when predicting global values of where humans reside?

Nieves et al utilize the random forest model in order to predict population density for certain regions around the globe. Random forest models use a technique known as 'bagging' to create a series of decision trees, then combine them into 'strong learners' to strengthen the accuracy of models. Furthermore, 1/3 of the data that is not used to grow these decision trees becomes 'out-of bag' data, which can calculate items such as error to measure variation. Stevens uses a random forest model in combination with dasymmetric methods in order to create weighted population layers. A dasymmetric population allocation redistributes population from census units into grid cells, allowing for greater detail in mapping. The most important geospatial covariates included transportation networks as well as essential infrastructure such as schools and hospitals that are necessary for civilization. Other major covariates include natural bodies such as rivers and mountains that can incentivize or disincentivize human activity.
