## Introduction
  My research intends to focus on the lessons that humanity has learned from disease epidemics as a result of big data application. I wish to study the correlation in West African nations between the implementation of local movement restrictions and the number of Ebola cases during the 2014-16 epidemic, emphasizing how freedom of movement impacts the functionality of this region in comparison to the rest of the world. In addition, I will employ data from other disease outbreaks in other regions of the world to determine whether negative West African reactions to government crackdowns of this magnitude is typical on a global scale. My methods will include the primary use of mobile phone data along with transportation models, and population data from within Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. This data will be combined with detailed grid-cell level population density counts as well as case maps from organizations such as WHO to map the impacts of government restrictions on viral spread. My goal is to bring awareness to ways that techniques to counter viral diseases can be improved in countries suffering from high rates of unrest or poverty. I hope to synthesize data from Ebola and other past epidemics that can help defeat the invisible enemy that currently threatens to shut down our society. Additionally, I intend to make my research applicable to the current global pandemic of COVID-19 that has now dwarfed the scale of the Ebola epidemic, as well as future outbreaks of less serious diseases such as malaria and yellow fever in Africa.

## Development Topics
  A lack of reliable infrastructure, along with poverty and moderate-scale corruption, are the major human development areas that allowed the Ebola outbreak to dramatically worsen in West Africa. Government decision-making over time may have worsened the scale of the Ebola crisis due to various factors such as weak health systems, lack of centralization, and perhaps most concerningly, a previously present yet growing steadily lack of public trust in authority. These circumstances have created serious external costs for the people of Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Guinea that extend beyond the scope of disease. My problem statement asks whether there is a statistical correlation between either active government issues, such as legislation that led to a spike in cases or failed to make any progress, or passive issues such as the ones mentioned above. In 2019, all three of the worst affected countries were ranked among the bottom fifteen in the world in the Human Development Index [8], suggesting a need to develop a framework to ensure success and happiness for their people. Finally, corruption had a small yet significant effect on the management of the crisis, with certain instances of parties disrupting quarantines in densely populated areas such as Monrovia [10]. While removing corruption is very difficult, coming together holds the utmost importance in a humanitarian disaster on the Ebolan scale.
  
  The dearth of human development and healthcare within West Africa matches the ideas proposed by Amartya Sen regarding freedom. A large economic disconnect is present between the people and the bureaucrats of the region. Sen emphasizes topics such as equality of opportunity as critical to the prospect of human freedom and advancement. Each person should receive adequate support and information from their government whether they live in the capital city or in rural villages hundreds of miles away. Anyone who does not receive basic resources necessary for life as a result of poor infrastructure cannot possibly be free enough to reach their full economic potential. By following Sen’s vision of development as freedom, the governments of Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone can prevent the next disease from growing out of control at the same magnitude of Ebola.
  
  In order to fix the unfreedoms that worsened the magnitude of the outbreak, leaders of West African nations must focus on certain aspects of life to reform. Some of the most pressing needs for the three Ebola-stricken countries are outlined in the ninth and sixteenth United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, promoting the building of reliable infrastructure with strong innovative solutions and an inclusive society with robust institutions, respectively. However, these goals will not provide the solutions to every problem. Innovations for poverty and inequality should be top priorities for West African nations in order to ensure that future viral outbreaks do not have a disproportionate impact on the less privileged population.

## Development Process
  The healthcare systems of the three most affected countries are vastly insufficient to handle an outbreak the size of the Ebola crisis. Liberia, for example, had fewer than 40 practicing doctors to treat a population of four million people and roughly eight hospital beds per 100,000 people when the virus first crossed its borders [9]. As a result of this shortage, much of the aid for the outbreak came from international organizations such as Doctors Without Borders. In fact, the Centers for Disease Control estimates that without this intervention, the number of cases may have tripled at the very least [7]. Many international healthcare workers employed by these organizations contracted the virus due to shortages of necessary personal protective equipment, allowing Ebola to spread more easily around the world. Additionally, the Ebola treatment centers built across the region were often unfriendly and terrifying to patients, particularly children. Some provinces, especially rural areas, saw large scale resistance to the presence of medical workers. Residents were already facing the idea of rejection from their own family, and now faced an invisible enemy fought by unknown soldiers in menacing full-body protective suits [6]. Violence ensued to such a degree that Doctors Without Borders and other samaritan groups were forced to abandon some village treatment centers for their own safety. The uncertainty of reliable healthcare in the region may have primarily contributed to these reactions. Another major factor that fostered conflict was the belief of the people that the government disregarded their culture by banning rituals such as washing bodies before burial. While this decision was made in good faith, as many citizens of Sierra Leone and Guinea caught the virus from said rituals, it reveals a lack of personal connection between the bureaucracy and the people, who felt that their customs were taken away with little justification. Any step toward preventing future outbreaks must allow citizens to understand and accept the reasoning.
  
  Healthcare in West Africa behaves as a complex adaptive system because of the many factors that must be addressed to engineer solutions in a modern world. Simply finding ways to build infrastructure in rural areas, for example, is not enough; in order to properly prepare, governments have to train more individuals to run the facilities and recognize symptoms of potentially threatening diseases. If the resources to scale up hospitals to the level of those in major cities may not be available, an affordable minimum standard that meets the needs of the people must be found and implemented to fix multiple parts of the healing countries. Ebola does tend to scale and emerge as hotspots in cities due to higher population density, but the response in cities is also elevated thanks to greater resources. Other parts of the countries have not been able to make up for the disadvantages as the next pandemic looms on the horizon.

## Methods
  Methods utilized in this research highlight the real effects of government legislation on the amount of travel and number of Ebola cases within the three most affected countries in West Africa, as well as variables displaying the economic and social effects of the epidemic. Transportation models help predict how the virus spreads between regions and estimate the effectiveness of government mobility tools. One such model estimated population using grid cells, applied mobility matrices to predict the movements of people within the outbreak area and the resulting transmission from their travel, and calculated which district in the region was responsible for transmitting the most cases to others [1]. This model revealed that much of the spread within Sierra Leone occurred within the nation’s borders, with capital cities Freetown and Conakry as the biggest “sinks” for transmission, suggesting that travel across adjacent borders was less of a factor than previously thought. However, it also reflects very poorly on the federal government, which closed the nation’s borders in June but did not implement local quarantines until September when the outbreak was far out of control. An additional study examined outbound air travel from the region, using flight data and a mathematical model to estimate the frequency at which infected travellers fly out of West African airports [4]. This study found that at the outbreak’s peak, more than one passenger per week was carrying the virus in Liberia and Sierra Leone, and called on leaders to install screening at points of departure. Doing so would prevent suspected cases from reaching destinations and potentially creating a new viral hotspot. Another way to analyze travel patterns involves using mobile phone data provided by telephone companies servicing West Africa, providing more practical analysis of how movement impacted the outbreak. This data allows researchers to track whether lockdown orders, once finally put in place, are being followed by the people. Phone data was assembled from 1.6 million subscribers in Sierra Leone, compared with lockdown dates in what became known as Operation Northern Push, and finally studied with an anomaly detection algorithm to highlight the deviation from normalcy [3]. Analysis of this dataset reveals that while the lockdown had a noticeable impact on travel in the long run, it took some time for the impact to become apparent. Governments wishing to apply large-scale lockdowns must ensure that the seriousness of the matter is extremely clear in order to get the desired results.
  
  In addition to travel, much of the data focuses on Ebola’s holistic effects for the three biggest hit nations. Cost is a variable that must be taken into account for treatment, as the virus brought the risk of West African economies being bulldozed. One study made use of a Monte Carlo model and streamline collections, as well as price data for medication, to estimate the real and opportunity costs of the outbreak [5]. Researchers found that Ebola cost the three countries at least $164 million, money that could have gone toward improving the overwhelmed healthcare system. However, much of that money was covered by international aid, helping to somewhat alleviate the burden. Furthermore, research on the genome of the virus using DNA mapping suggests that few mutations occurred, but lack of social distancing was a primary transfer point in many communities [2]. Large scale lockdowns may not be the appropriate solution for a virus that spreads with relative difficulty compared to the flu or yellow fever. West African governments, and others around the world, must study with great interest the best ways to balance safety, development, and freedom.

## Discussion
  I believe that the current outbreak of COVID-19 will greatly benefit my research as scientists search for new and innovative techniques to combat the current virus. Many virologists and medical advisors are turning to lessons from the Ebola response in order to manage and prevent the possibility of healthcare systems becoming overwhelmed and thousands of people dying. As more data from the ongoing epidemic is published, it will be easier to make specific comparisons to the Ebola situation and provide recommendations for tactics to slow further spread of the coronavirus. Additionally, the COVID-19 situation will hopefully draw greater focus to areas with high spread, hopefully inspiring governments to make decisions in the best interests of their citizens rather than turning to weak and ineffective solutions. At the moment, one prominent gap in my research is the potential availability and safety of potential treatments for Ebola within Africa. In comparison to other viruses with past outbreaks, virologists have made very little progress in fighting Ebola, with the only treatments manufactured to fight the disease being highly experimental and expensive. Much of the modern care for Ebola is based around the treatment of specific symptoms rather than eliminating the presence of the virus from the body. Furthermore, even if scientists manage to develop an effective vaccine before the next major outbreak in West Africa, the question looms of whether governments can be trusted enough for a vaccine to slow the spread of the virus and whether a potential treatment will be viable at all for countries with high levels of poverty and many people living in isolated villages in eastern Guinea and Sierra Leone and northern Liberia. I want my research question to focus on the effectiveness of government responses in navigating their countries throughout the crisis and incorporate the impacts of variables such as weak infrastructure, corruption, and public distrust that fostered violence and resistance to treatment.
