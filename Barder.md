# Barder Response

Question 14:

Barder advocates resisting engineering because engineering solutions will quickly cause policy to fall behind evolutionary adaptations within a complex adaptive system. In addition, he emphasizes several times that complex adaptive systems are non-linear, and attempts to engineer resolutions will eventually fail since these systems are virtually unpredictable over time.

Isomorphic mimicry is another technique that Barder believes should be avoided at all costs. He uses the example of frogs that have the appearance of being poisonous in order to scare off potential predators while actually being harmless. However, in terms of institutions, isomorphic mimicry has a negative effect instead of the positive effect it had on the frogs. He emphasizes that it is easy to create a system that appears to be functional at first glance, but creating a system that actually performs its intended function is much more difficult.

Question 7:

The Ajaoukuta Steel Works in Nigeria is the product of one of the largest investments in steel ever. Yet despite the large labor and capital present in the system, Ajaoukuta has proven to be a complete failure in terms of production. Corruption and poor management are likely to blame for this failure. Ajaoukuta illustrates a shift away from the Washington Consensus, revealing that institutions are more to blame for economic failures than policies. The facility had the policies and government support to be successful, yet corrupt institutions prevented it from ever leaving the ground.
