# City of God Essay

 The Social Network Era has taken over the world with a huge bang over the last few decades. Communication has helped to build up cities and connect people in extraordinary ways, leading to unprecedented levels of development on a global scale. Geoff West’s description of cities as emergent from human communication strongly applies to cities that built their way out of poverty into sprawling metropoles. However, the actual method in which these cities transform remains heavily dependent on the way the residents choose to interact with each other. In City of God, the transformation of Rio de Janeiro reflects the immense impacts of communication on the development of a major urban center. Rio’s growth as a social hub draws from the city’s unique economic situation, the various illicit hierarchies that defined the city for a decade, and the detailed relationships between groups with differing roles portrayed in the film.
  
 Financial circumstances portrayed in City of God suggest that social networking played a key role in revamping Rio. At the beginning of the film, the main characters reside in a small slum and appear to be desperate to obtain cash in any way possible. The Tender Trio gets much of their cash from holdups of small institutions such as the gas tank driver and the motel. The glorification of such small acts emphasizes that the early gangs did not have much of a vision for future development of their lives. They were entirely focused on the present, even with the risks of throwing away their future that were eventually presented when Goose was exiled from Rocket’s family. Only in the face of direct apprehension from the police were the hoods willing to view self-preservation as more important than self-fulfillment. On the other hand, as the film progressed, the characters became more open with their interactions, as revealed by the many parties attended by Lil Z that included interactions with commoners. By this point, petty holdups became a detriment to Lil Z, who started the war with Carrot because of the petty robberies in his territory taken up by the Runts. The division of Rio by faction between Lil Z and Carrot illustrates the power of organized crime to control the entire city, allowing it to grow around the illicit drug trade. Even uninvolved parties knew better than to cross over the boundary between each side, suggesting a deep level of centralization in play. Once economic activity coalesced around drugs as a source of income, the city experienced much greater uplift with an anchor of social networking to build around.
  
 Additionally, the detailed social structures that came into play in City of God illustrate the city’s dependence on social networking for growth. The rising number of characters throughout the film suggest that interaction became much more complex over time. With the bosses as the top of the food chain well established, the continued ballooning of their ranks through minor characters such as Steak and Otto portrays the development of the city around the social battle for control between Lil Z and Carrot. City residents were unable to escape the violence, so they chose the side that they felt best suited them in order to seize their chance to gain power. As Lil Z grew more powerful, he slowly developed the entire city of Rio into his own vision through recruitment efforts, with Knockout Ned doing the same in the latter half of the film. Additionally, many independent institutions appear to scale with the rising power of the gang hierarchies over Rio. Most notably, a weapons dealer who approaches the police after Lil Z’s band takes his guns without paying is shot down by a cop who wishes to take down the criminal organizations in his own regard. Also standing out is Ned’s death at the hands of Otto, who wished to avenge his father, a policeman who represented Ned’s first kill as part of Carrot’s gang. Furthermore, the press represents the growth of the concept of freedom, unfazed by Lil Z’s threats and willing to engage both sides at the front line to preserve the concept of journalism. Each of these connections signifies how Rio rose both with the criminal gangs and in response to them, with crime holding most power yet individualism and independence remaining a part of the city’s spirit in the face of danger. As Rio’s criminal enterprises evolved, the rest of the city built complementary social connections in order to keep up.
  
 Finally, patterns of behavior that resulted in characters reaching new heights serve as metaphors for the grand transformation that redefined Rio in City of God. One example of a dramatic personal transformation is the advance of Lil Z. He decides that he does not want to spend his early life serving as a lackey, so he shoots up the motel in direct defiance of Shaggy’s orders and runs away, eventually killing Goose to complete his rise. Lil Z exemplifies the surge of the city around him, going from a powerless child to a commanding boss with an appetite for blood. Similarly, in the social sphere of a major city like Rio, those who take the opportunity to build connections will rise through the ranks, while those who cannot do so are chewed up and spit out by the institutions that determine success, resulting in a great deal of unhappiness. Lil Z helps to disprove the First Law of Geography proposed by Tobler that people are not in charge of their own destiny. However, the development of the protagonist Rocket is even stronger proof that lives are not predetermined. Rocket evolves from a fairly weak character trying to find his own way, losing his girlfriend to the gang along the way. However, his persistence pays off when he lands a job as a photographer and finds immediate glory in that profession, with his initially negative reaction to Marina’s behavior eventually subsiding to happiness when they fall in love. Rocket disproves his own words from the opening scene when he finds himself in a much better place after the conclusion of the gang war, becoming famous while his enemies lie dead. He worked his way out of the standoff situation to improve his own standing in life. Rocket symbolizes the restoration of hope after all hope has been lost, just as the first residents of the City of God lost all hope that their home would be any better when they grew up and managed to break through with the power of social networking.
  
 Rio’s rise from a city of poverty to one of power is a result of the blossoming of civil connections on many different levels. Drugs inspired networking from a financial standpoint, while the social hierarchies built up a desire to grow personally and break free from the stereotypical view of the City of God. After all, the urbanization of Rio is truly a reflection of the urbanization of the people, who formed stronger connections and adapted new ways to live their lives as networking grew more prominent and vital for life in the new and improved city that they call home.
