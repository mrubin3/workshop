Specific geospatial data is very important in the area of disease control. Knowing exactly where populations live allows for planning with regard to spread and greatly simplifies the process of establishing lockdowns and quarantines. This allows models to map the virulence of a pathogen in order to keep others safe. Another benefit is the ability to measure whether each person has adequate access to healthcare, allowing for the necessary improvements to be made. Geospatial mapping is a critical element for human development with regard to health and must be heavily emphasized as a new pandemic rises.
